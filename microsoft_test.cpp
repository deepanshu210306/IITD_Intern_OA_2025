// first question was easy peasy 
// we has to calc min difference between any pair in a vector and 
// then print all the pairs of the vector element whose difference was equal to that diff


// second question was also really easy 
// we had to make a text editor using string 
// there were many fucntions like inserting , deletion , and we has a cursor to maintain 
// that points to a certain index and we had to make few function to control movement of that cursor 
// all the description was given in the question on that basis we have to design the different functions

//OA was really Easy it was trying to judge on the basis of speed
